# Pull Requests

We welcome contributions through pull requests for minor changes, like typos,
bug fixes in example code etc. Any large change should be first discussed in an
issue, and should be assigned to the pull request. This will increase the
chances that your pull request is accepted.


# Branch Policy

The `master` branch is stable at all times, and will only be updated for new
releases or bugfixes. This branch will be released regularly.

The `dev` branch is the main development branch, **all pull-requests should be
submitted to `dev`.** It might be unstable at times.

Any other branch is likely a working branch, and might contain incomplete
changes.  Do not attempt to deploy, or file any pull-request against them.


# Code Style

The project uses `rustfmt` to produce a reproducible and consistent style
throughout all source code. Please make sure to format all your code.
